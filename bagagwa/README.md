# PS5 Relapse Exploit
Supported firmware: 7.00 through 13.60.

## Usage
- In the network settings, set Primary DNS to `45.56.67.85` (Recommended)
- Run `python serve.py` locally, or open https://ntfargo.github.io/Relapse-Exploit/ on the PS5.
- The default payloads are stored in `payloads/` after a successful run, the ELF loader listens on port `9021`.
- After elfldr starts on port `9021`, you can press R2 to send `kstuff.elf`, `shadowmountplus.elf`, then `etaHEN.elf`.

## Stability notes
Webkit may need several attempts, reload the page if the browser stalls. The kernel exploit may hang or panic the console, so reboot before trying again if that happens.

## Exploit chain
Browser stage uses JSC info leaks and a structured clone object pool mismatch to corrupt a typedarray. The kernel stage combines a address leak with an `aio_multi_wait` uaf race to establish kernel r/w.
